# How it works

All API calls are in the documentation : Api.html.
Generated by NelmioApiDocBundle. Please re-generate the documentation to have an up-to-date one.

## Localization

There is a city database with the most used cities (linked with a country table). Basic GET will search on that database.

If you need to add one, there is a location service which able to retrieve city information (latitude, longitude ...) by OpenStreetMap (Nominatim), Google Map ...

Service made with BazingaGeocoderBundle.

We used JMSSerializerBundle for serialization with groups annotations in models.
